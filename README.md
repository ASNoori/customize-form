# CustomizeForm

In this particular project, Angular has been used to build a customizable interface for the website. The customization options include modifying the header, sidebar, footer, applying dark or light mode, and customizing colors. Users can select these options through a customization settings form.

Header Customization:

Fixed or Sticky: Users can choose whether the header remains fixed at the top of the page or becomes sticky, scrolling along with the content.

Sidebar Customization:

Collapsed or Fixed: Users can opt to collapse the sidebar, accessible via a toggle button, or keep it fixed and expanded by default.

Footer Customization:

Fixed or Hide: Users can decide whether the footer remains fixed at the bottom of the page or is hidden from view.

Dark/Light Mode:

Users can choose dark and light mode for the entire page. Dark mode provides a dark color scheme that is easier on the eyes in low-light environments, while light mode offers a brighter interface.

Customized Colors:

Users have the ability to apply customized colors to various elements of the page. This includes changing the background color, text color, button color, and other interface elements, allowing for a personalized visual experience.

To access these customization options, users can interact with a dedicated custmoization settings form.
